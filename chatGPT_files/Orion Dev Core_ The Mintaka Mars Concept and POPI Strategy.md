This is a completely valid concern, especially given the strictness of the POPI Act in South Africa. You are right—putting your home address on a public-facing global website is unnecessary exposure. Here is the plan to fix the privacy issue while keeping the artistic vision you requested. \#\#\# 1\. The "POPI-Proof" Address Strategy We need to remove your home address immediately from the codebase and public documents. Here is the professional alternative: \* **Option A (The Digital Nomad):** Remove the street address entirely. Use "KZN, South Africa" or just "South Africa." Tech companies rarely list physical doors anymore. \* **Option B (The Virtual Office):** Use a PostNet Suite or a Virtual Office address (e.g., Regus in Durban/Umhlanga) if you legally need a physical address for invoicing. \* **Action for Code:** I will strip 26 Vasco Da Gama from the footer and contact sections in the code below and replace it with KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. \#\#\# 2\. The Website Concept: "Mintaka" *The Code meets Art.* You asked for "Jackson Pollock meets Salvador Dali meets Picasso in a dry bar on Mars." This translates to a UI that is: \* **Pollock:** Chaotic, animated background particles (energy). \* **Dali:** Surreal, glass-morphism cards that distort the background (melting clocks vibe). \* **Picasso:** Cubist, sharp angles in the layout and grid system. \* **Mars:** A deep red/orange/black colour palette instead of the standard corporate blue. \#\#\# 3\. The Code: index.html (The Art-House Version) *I have removed your address and implemented the "Mars Bar" aesthetic.* \`\`\`html ORION DEV CORE | The Art of Intelligence ORIONDEVHotel SuitePhilosophyPartner Access

In the style of Jackson Pollock and Salvador Dali. Melting clocks drape over cubist furniture. The colors are deep ochre, rust orange, and void black. Abstract energy lines connect the patrons. High definition, digital art."* Would you like me to generate a **Sales Manual Cover Page** using this "Mintaka" art style as well, to keep the branding consistent for your new agents?
