## THE PROBLEM

Every day you're losing money to:
- **Delayed payments** - Clients "forget" to pay deposits
- **Time wasted** - 10 minutes per quote creating payment links manually
- **Missed opportunities** - Slow response time = jobs going to competitors
- **Cash flow issues** - Waiting weeks for payment while you've already bought materials

**What if clients could pay their deposit in 30 seconds, automatically, while you're still on the job site?**

---

## THE SOLUTION: ORION PAYMENT AUTOMATION

A complete payment management system that integrates with your existing tools:

### WHAT IT DOES:

**1. INSTANT PAYMENT LINK GENERATION**

## ROI BREAKDOWN

### YOUR CURRENT SITUATION:
- Creating payment links manually: 10 min/quote
- 20 quotes per month = 200 minutes wasted
- Your time is worth R500/hour minimum
- **Time cost: R1,650/month**

Plus:
- Delayed payments = poor cash flow
- Missed deposits = you buy materials out of pocket
- Manual follow-ups = lost revenue from incomplete jobs

### WITH ORION:
- Payment links: 10 seconds/quote
- 20 quotes = 3 minutes total
- **Time saved: R1,640/month**

Plus:
- Instant deposits = better cash flow
- Automated reminders = higher payment rates
- Professional image = more jobs won

**MONTHLY VALUE: R3,000-5,000**  
**YOUR INVESTMENT: R1,500/month (after 3 free months)**  
**NET GAIN: R1,500-3,500/month**

### BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS:
If this system helps you land just **ONE extra R2,000 job per month**, it pays for itself.

## GUARANTEE

**I'm confident this will transform your business. Here's my guarantee:**

If after 30 days of using the system:
- It hasn't saved you time
- It hasn't improved your cash flow
- You're not happy with it

**I'll refund 50% of your setup fee (R1,250) - no questions asked.**

You only risk R1,250 to potentially gain R3,000+/month in value.

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 3 MONTHS?

**Month 4 Conversation:**

I'll send you a report showing:
- Total payments processed
- Time saved
- Jobs won faster due to quick response
- Cash flow improvement

Then I'll ask: **"Want to continue at R1,500/month?"**

By then, you'll have:
- Processed R50,000+ in payments
- Saved 10+ hours of admin time
- Won 3-5 extra jobs due to faster response
- Improved cash flow significantly

**You'll gladly pay R1,500/month because the value is 3-5x the cost.**
